As the principal plantation street, Mulberry Row was the center of work and domestic life for dozens of people—free whites, free blacks, indentured servants, and enslaved people. It was populated by more than 20 dwellings, workshops, and storehouses between 1770 and the sale of Monticello in 1831.
More than 20 structures were built on Mulberry Row during Jefferson’s lifetime, including the joiner’s shop, workmen’s house, nailery, and Negro quarter.
