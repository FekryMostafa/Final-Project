What you are looking forward to in 1L year?
I am looking forward to meeting my classmates, professors, and the rest of the faculty. I love trying new restaurants, coffee shops, and browsing bookstores. Lexington has so much to offer, and I’m excited to get settled soon.
Hobby/Interest?
I am a violinist! It is a very important part of my life, and I hope to continue playing at W&L.
Why W&L Law?
I was born and raised in Charleston, West Virginia, and I have always been familiar with W&L as a school close to home. When beginning my law school research, I couldn’t help but to fall in love with the uplifting environment and top-tier education provided by W&L Law. After my first visit to campus, I knew this was the right place for me. I look forward to making a positive impact during my time here and beyond.
