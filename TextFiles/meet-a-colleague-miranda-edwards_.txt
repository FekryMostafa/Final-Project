W&L News OfficeOctober 18, 2023
Q. How long have you worked at W&L?
I have been working at W&L for 16 years.
Q. What do you like most about working at W&L?
The friendships I keep with the students after they graduate.
Q. Where is your favorite location on the W&L campus?
I love The Colonnade. No matter the season or whether it is day or night, the view is always spectacular!
Q. Where did you grow up?
I grew up right here in Lexington.
Q. If you could live anywhere, where would you build your dream home?
Somewhere tropical with crystal blue water and white sand. I do not like the cold weather!
Q. Who most inspires you?
My daughter Hunter and my son Brady. My daughter has amazing faith. Her dedication and work ethic, her caring for others in her community and her strive to make a difference is out of this world. My son is becoming an EMT/Firefighter. It is an honorable profession and it takes a special kind of person to be willing to risk their own life for someone else’s.
Q. What book are you reading now?
“Girl, Stop Apologizing” by Rachel Hollis.
Q. What music are you listening to these days?
I listen to a variety of music all the time.
Q. Your favorite film (movie) of all time?
“Pride & Prejudice.”  This movie was first introduced to me and my daughter by Rebecca Koval. She was my very first Work-Study student I had when I started here at W&L.
Q. If they made a movie about your life, who would play you?
I was just recently told by a co-worker Sandra Bullock, so I’m going with her.
Q. If you could have coffee with one person, who would it be and why?
It would be my Dad! It wouldn’t be coffee because he didn’t drink it. I’d say more like a beer or a margarita! He passed away before my son was born and I would love for him to meet him.
