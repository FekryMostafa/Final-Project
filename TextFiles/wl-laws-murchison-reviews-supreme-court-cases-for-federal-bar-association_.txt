On August 31, 2023, Washington and Lee Professor Brian Murchison joined Roanoke litigator Jay O’Keeffe in reviewing notable cases of the 2022 October Term of the Supreme Court at a chapter meeting of the Federal Bar Association.
The Western District of Virginia Chapter of the Federal Bar Association is comprised of the Roanoke Division of the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. The Chapter has served the Roanoke area since it was chartered in 2011 and has approximately 100 members from private practice, government agencies, local law schools, and local courts.
Professor Murchison discussed two cases from the term that ended in June:  Biden v. Nebraska, in which six states challenged the President’s student loan forgiveness plan on statutory grounds (including “major questions doctrine” grounds); and Counterman v. Colorado, in which a cyber-stalker sought First Amendment protection for speech expressing “true threats.”
Mr. O’Keeffe, a partner at MichieHamlett and publisher of DeNovo: A Virginia Appellate Law Blog, reviewed other key cases from the Term, including Allen v. Milligan (upholding three-judge district court decision that Alabama’s redistricting plan likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act; Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College (striking down affirmative action programs in college admissions); and 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis (finding First Amendment-based protection for website designer who did not want to create websites for same-sex weddings).
