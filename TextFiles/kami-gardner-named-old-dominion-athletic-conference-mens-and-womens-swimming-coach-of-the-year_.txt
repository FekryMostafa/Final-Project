Kami Gardner, director of aquatics and head coach of men’s and women’s swimming at Washington and Lee University, was selected as the 2024 Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) Men’s and Women’s Swimming Coach of the Year in voting conducted by the league’s coaches.
Gardner’s women’s team has produced a 6-1 overall record this winter, claiming the program’s third-straight ODAC title after winning 10 of the 18 events at the championship meet last weekend. The Generals have now won 33 conference championships in the last 37 years.
Gardner guided Brynn Martinson ‘24 to three individual wins and the ODAC Championship Swimmer of the Meet honors. Her 100 freestyle time of 50.90 was a conference and conference championship meet record time. The 800 freestyle relay also secured a championship meet record time of 7:36.87.
Gardner led the men’s program to its ninth ODAC championship in the last 10 years, finishing with a 6-1 record as well. The Blue & White claimed 12 wins out of the 18 championship events, including two individual conference and conference championship meet records and new conference and championship meet records for all five relay teams. Charles Byars ‘26 posted a record time of 49.21 in the 100 backstroke, and Dalton Jobe ’26 posted a record time of 3:56.50 in the 400 individual medley.
W&L now awaits word from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) on whether any men’s or women’s swimmers will qualify for the Division III National Championship, to be held March 20-23 in Greensboro, North Carolina.
All told, Gardner has posted a 124-36 (.775) overall record in charge of the women’s team and a 79-17 (.823) overall mark with the men’s team. She’s claimed 15 total ODAC Coach of the Year citations in her 17 years at W&L, 10 with the women and five with the men.
Gardner has been a member of the W&L faculty since 2007. She holds a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Kenyon College and a master’s degree in sports management from Western Illinois University.
