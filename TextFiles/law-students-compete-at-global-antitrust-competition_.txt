Members of the W&L Antitrust and Consumer Law Society at Washington and Lee University School of Law recently competed at the Global Antitrust Institute Invitational, a moot court competition hosted by George Mason Law School.
W&L Law fielded two teams for the competition, including the team of Jack Perryman ’25L and Jack Kellerman ’25L and the team of Nicole Jia ’26L and Simon Ciccarillo ’24L. Following two rounds of oral arguments, Perryman and Kellerman emerged as the runners-up in the competition. They were also recognized with the best defendant’s brief award.
The students competed against representatives from more than dozen law schools, arguing before high level FTC officials as well as Judge Douglas Ginsburg, Senior Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
