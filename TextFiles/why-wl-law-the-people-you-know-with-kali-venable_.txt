When I was applying to law school one of the factors that was really important to me was having a loyal alumni network. When it comes to the legal field, who you know and the people who you know in different areas, especially, you know, different practices is extremely important. So that was something I was really looking for in a law school. And here at W&L when I spoke with alumni, both those who had graduated recently, those who had graduated, you know, decades ago, I could tell that they were still extremely involved in the school, extremely enthusiastic about the school and really willing to do whatever they could to support the students here.
