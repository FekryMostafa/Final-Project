“In this moment of profound social division…people in positions of power — especially those who have, on record, repeatedly demonized others — would do well to avoid willfully co-opting a term that denotes tragic events in which the disempowered were persecuted and prosecuted. As ever, history matters, not only in informing the meaning behind terminology like ‘witch hunt,’ but in understanding the weight of words articulated by the powerful.”
Mikki Brock is an assistant professor of history at Washington & Lee University and the author of Satan and the Scots: The Devil in Post-Reformation Scotland, c. 1560-1700.” Her opinion piece, “No, there is no witch hunt against powerful men,” was published in The Washington Post on October 18, 2017.
