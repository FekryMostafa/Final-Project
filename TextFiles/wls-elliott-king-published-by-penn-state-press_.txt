Elliott King, associate professor of art history at Washington and Lee University, co-edited a book titled “Radical Dreams: Surrealism, Counterculture, Resistance” as a part of Penn State University Press’ “Refiguring Modernism” series. 
According to the book’s description, “surrealism’s committed engagement extends beyond the parameters of an artistic style or historical period, with chapters devoted to Afrosurrealism, Ted Joans, punk, the Situationist International, the student protests of May ’68 and other topics.”
As part of the book’s launch, King participated in a panel titled “Art as Radicalism,” organized by Penn State University Press on March 18. 
King will participate in another panel on Aug. 8, 2022, titled “Radical Dreams and Chicago Surrealism: A conversation with Penelope Rosemont, Abigail Susik, and Elliott H. King,” and organized by The Last Tuesday Society.
