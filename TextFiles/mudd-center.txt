2023-2024: Ethics of Design


Design thinking shapes our experiences in fundamental ways, even when it is essentially invisible to us. The Ethics of Design series will investigate the roles and processes of design with respect to products, programs, technologies, and systems. We will consider how design thinking might address modern ethical dilemmas that we collectively face and what methodologies might allow professionals across disciplines to meaningfully assess the ethical contexts and implications of their work.
