Hello and welcome to the Department of Psychology at Skidmore College! Our goal is
                           to help students understand the exciting and quickly changing field of psychological
                           science. We provide psychology majors a foundation in experimental methodology and
                           scientific writing early in their curriculum to prepare them for the advanced-level
                           courses and research experiences that are critical to understanding and conducting
                           psychological science.
