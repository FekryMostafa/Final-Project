Spanish audio is a service provided in addition to the regular program audio. To access this service, you must change the setting on your television, cable set-top box or VCR to SAP audio. In some cases, the remote controls for these devices will have an SAP or "audio select" setting that switches you to SAP audio. Video Description is also available on the SAP audio channel for selected movies and programs. Video Description is a service provided to blind or visually impaired viewers in which the action on-screen is verbally described along with the regular program audio. When you access the Lifetime SAP channel, you will hear a Spanish program, a Video Described program or our looped recording: "You are listening to Lifetime Television's SAP channel...." If you are having difficulty receiving Lifetime's SAP channel, you should check with your local cable provider.
