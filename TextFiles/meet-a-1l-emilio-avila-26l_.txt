What are you looking forward to in 1L year?
I’m really looking forward to meeting my 1L classmates, the professors, and the rest of the faculty. I’ve never lived outside of California, so I’m very excited to experience Lexington and become a member of the W&L community.
Hobby/Interest?
Tinkering with cars, true crime documentaries, podcasts about political news and technology, scary movies, and Formula 1.
Why W&L Law?
When I began to research W&L Law, I learned that their alumni had a reputation for being extremely supportive of one another, and I loved that they were frequently described online as “fanatics.” I initially applied because of W&L Law’s reputation for its incredibly supportive community and high-quality legal education, but my decision to attend was sealed as soon as my tour of the campus concluded. The admissions office was incredible and genuinely interested in me as a person. My family and I were blown away by the beauty of Lexington and the W&L campus. I’m extremely excited to be a part of the Class of 2026!
