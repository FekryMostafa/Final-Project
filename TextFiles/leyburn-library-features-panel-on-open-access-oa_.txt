The Leyburn Library is hosting an Open Access (OA) Panel on Oct. 21 at 4 p.m. in Leyburn Library’s Northen Auditorium. The panel is in celebration of Open Access Week (Oct. 19–25).
The OA Panel is open to the public and apple cider and cookies will be provided.
The panel discussion will feature Washington and Lee authors who have published in OA journals. Provost Daniel Wubah; Jon Erickson, associate professor of engineering; and Nadia Ayoub, associate professor of biology, will serve as panelists.
Before the session begins, Alston Cobourn, assistant professor and digital scholarship librarian, will provide a brief overview of what OA is, discuss how she and the university library are involved in OA and will introduce the panelists. The panelists will discuss the process involved in publishing in an OA journal and why they choose to publish in one.
If you know any W&L faculty who would be great profile subjects, tell us about them! Nominate them for a web profile.
