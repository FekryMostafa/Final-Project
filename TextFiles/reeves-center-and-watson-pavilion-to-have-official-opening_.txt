Washington and Lee University’s Reeves Center and Watson Pavilion will have an official “opening” on Thursday, Jan. 22, from 5-7 p.m. They will now be open to the public on a regular basis and their new hours will be 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Saturday.
There will be guided tours of the galleries and a drawing for a reservation at the next public tea ceremony will be held.
The Reeves Center and Watson Pavilion hold the fourth-largest collection of Chinese porcelain in the United States, the paintings of 20th-century painter, Louise Herreshoff, the Custis-Lee paintings, the tea room and a student-curated exhibit on armorial porcelain replacements.
There also is a temporary museum shop in the Watson Pavilion where books, busts and Lee Chapel plates, as well as other items, can be purchased.
After the renovations are completed in Lee Chapel, the Reeves Center and Watson Pavilion will remain open to the public at the above-mentioned hours. The temporary museum shop will close and move back to its regular spot in Lee Chapel.
