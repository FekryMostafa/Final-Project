W&L Law students Kristin Barkemeyer ‘22L and Max Blumenthal ‘24L recently competed as a team in the Global Antitrust Institute (GAI) Invitational Moot Court Competition. The GAI Invitational is the only moot court competition in the United States devoted exclusively to antitrust law.
Barkemeyer won the top award of Best Oralist for the entire competition. As a team, Barkemeyer and Blumenthal finished the competition as semifinalists, facing teams from the law schools at Harvard and the University of Missouri in the final rounds.
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
