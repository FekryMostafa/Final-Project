Hometown: Virginia Beach, Virginia
Major: Business administration major, environmental studies minor
Why did you choose to come to W&L?
W&L was a place where I could get an incredible education, play the sport I love and join a community built upon integrity and respect.
Have you discovered a course or topic that you didn’t expect to study when you first came to W&L?
I came in knowing that I wanted to do something business related but had no idea about my passion for the environment. Earth and environmental geoscience professor Lisa Greer’s Global Climate Change course was a great place to start.
Where is your “home” on campus?
The W&L football team!
How have your experiences at W&L prepared you for post-graduate success?
The W&L alumni network is as strong as they come. Every alum I have reached out to has been willing to chat and pass along their knowledge as a postgraduate. Also, the liberal arts experience produces well-rounded individuals as they enter the workforce.
What do you like about being a DIII athlete?
I play for the love of the game and have opportunities to pursue other interests as well.
