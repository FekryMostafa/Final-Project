The Foundation is privileged to offer organizations and individuals with a demonstrated commitment to our mission of preservation and education the opportunity to conduct special educational tours and lectures with accompanying meetings or social events. Whether hosting a corporate reception or a thought-provoking lecture and retreat, there is no place more distinctive and inspiring. Combining the power of place with the power of ideas, here you can entertain your guests against the backdrop of the only presidential home in America designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Events can also be paired with tours of Monticello and tailored to a variety of interests, including architecture, decorative arts, politics, science, slavery and freedom, wine, and more. Private viewings of the exhibitions at the Visitor Center, as well as private tours of Monticello, can also be arranged in conjunction with your event.
As a Site of Conscience, we are committed to engaging our guests with a deeper understanding of Monticello’s history as a plantation. Out of respect for the enslaved men, women, and children who lived and labored here, we do not allow private, non-educational events on the West Lawn, Mulberry Row, or elsewhere on the mountaintop.
To inquire about hosting your event at one of our venue spaces, please fill out the Event Inquiry Form, or contact us at 434-984-9821 or events@monticello.org. Site visits for any of our spaces requires advance notice.
