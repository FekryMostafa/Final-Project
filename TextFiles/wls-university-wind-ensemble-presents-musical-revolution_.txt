Join W&L’s University Wind Ensemble for their Fall Term concert, “Musical (R)evolution” on Nov. 6 at 8 p.m. in Wilson Concert Hall in the Lenfest Center for the Performing Arts.
The performance is free and open to the public and no tickets are required. The event will also be streamed online at livestream.com/wlu.
In their performance, the University Wind Ensemble will push the boundaries of traditional band repertoire while also paying tribute to the early revolutionaries of the genre. The program will explore numerous spatial, tonal and conceptual possibilities through the works of renowned composers and arrangers, including Eric Whitacre and Michael Sweeney.
