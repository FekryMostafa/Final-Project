Washington and Lee University presents the Fall Choral Concert on Tuesday, Oct. 24 at 8 p.m. in Wilson Concert Hall in the Lenfest Center for the Performing Arts. The performance will feature W&L’s University Singers, Glee Club and Cantatrici.
The performance is free, but tickets are required and available online. The event will also be streamed online at livestream.com/wlu.
The first half of the concert will be centered around Latvian composer Laura Jekabsone’s “Sudabra Mēness” and Felix Mendelssohn’s “I Waited for the Lord,” featuring solos by music majors Sarah Gaberielle Lynch ’24 and Meredith Harron ’26. The University Singers, conducted by Shane M. Lynch, professor of music and director of choral activities, will then perform a set thematically inspired by “Light, Stars and Fire,” featuring Andrea Ramsey’s “Stomp on the Fire,” followed by a set of accompanied music that spotlights Rossini’s “I Gondolieri” with Anna Billias, lecturer in music, accompanying the ensemble on the piano.
Traditional favorites will round out the performance, closing with James Erb’s arrangement of “Shenandoah.”
