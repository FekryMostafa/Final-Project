Tara Blackwell, a member of the Law Class of 2024, has been chosen for a 2022 Rural Summer Legal Corps Fellowship. Blackwell was one of 40 law students chosen from over 300 applications to the prestigious fellowship program.
The Rural Summer Legal Corps Fellowship is a partnership between Equal Justice Works, the nation’s largest facilitator of opportunities in public interest law, and the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), the nation’s single largest funder of civil legal aid for low-income Americans. Program participants spend eight to ten weeks hosted by LSC-funded civil legal aid organizations, where they help address challenges facing rural communities.
Blackwell’s host organization is the Center for Arkansas Legal Services (CALS), where she will work on “Keeping it in the Family,” a special initiative to reduce generational poverty through home ownership and estate planning. As a Student Fellow, Blackwell will help protect family land through “Wills on Wheels” clinics to prevent title issues before they occur, participate in community outreach, and provide litigation support to CALS staff attorneys.
Launched in 2016, RSLC Student Fellows have helped increase access to justice for thousands of individuals living in rural communities. In 2021, law students in the program collectively contributed 10,746 hours to help rural communities, with 4,492 hours spent on direct legal services. These Student Fellows also participated in 154 outreach events, created or expanded more than 170 collaborations with community partners, and provided legal information to more than 900 individuals.
