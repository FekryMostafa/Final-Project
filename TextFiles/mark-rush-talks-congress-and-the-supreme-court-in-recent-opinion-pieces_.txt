Mark Rush, the Stanley D. and Nikki Waxberg Professor of Politics and Law at Washington and Lee University, published opinion pieces in the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Fulcrum in September expressing his views on Congress and the Supreme Court.
In the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Rush writes, “If Congress successfully limits Supreme Court terms and the number of appointments a president may make, the appointment process will become even more politicized. As judicial terms come to an end, battle plans will be drawn in anticipation of what will become regularly scheduled replacement hearings.” Read the entire op-ed here.
In The Fulcrum, he notes, “Instead of overhauling the Supreme Court, perhaps lawmakers and other aspiring fixers might first give Congress itself some homework. Before turning on the court, perhaps Congress could first demonstrate a capacity to put partisanship aside and pursue an agenda that is unquestionably bipartisan and clearly in the national interest.” You can read the full piece here.
