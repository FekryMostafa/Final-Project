The moment that really struck me as being when I knew W&L was where I wanted to focus my attention for admission, was sitting in on Professor Baluarte’s immigration law class. So I visited in October of 2021, and took a really wonderful tour. At the end of that tour, I was able to sit in on a class and I just felt like–to quote Hamilton at you–I just felt like ‘this is the room where it happens.’ And I want to be in that room. I didn’t feel that anywhere else that I visited. And I really felt it here. And so I’ve just been so glad to be a member of the class now and feel that every day.
