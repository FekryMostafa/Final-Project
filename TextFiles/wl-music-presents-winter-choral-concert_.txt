Washington and Lee University presents the Winter Choral Concert on Tuesday, March 14, at 8 p.m. in the Wilson Concert Hall in the Lenfest Center for the Performing Arts.
The performance is free and open to the public, and tickets are required. The event will also be streamed online at livestream.com/wlu.
An evocative evening of progressive choral storytelling, the concert will feature Cantatrici (women’s choir), conducted by Lacey Lynch, lecturer in music, and the W&L Glee Club, conducted by Shane Lynch, associate professor of music and director of choral activities. The program will explore the sounds of opera, modern choral, folk rock and avant-garde composition by showcasing a wide range of composers, from Giuseppe Verdi to James Taylor. At the thematic heart of the performance, the ensembles tell the story of “the hero,” from the call to adventure through trials, crisis and battle, and ultimately to victory.
