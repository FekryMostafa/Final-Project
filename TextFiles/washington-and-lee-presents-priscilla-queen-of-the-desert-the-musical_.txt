Washington and Lee University presents Robert O. and Elizabeth M. Bentley’s production of “Priscilla Queen of the Desert the Musical,” directed and choreographed by Jenefer Davies, associate professor of dance/theater at W&L. The show runs Oct. 25-27 at 7:30 p.m., and Oct. 28 at 2 p.m. in the Keller Theatre on the W&L campus. The show is recommended for mature audiences.
This musical is a heartwarming, uplifting adventure of a trio of performers— drag queens Tick, Adam and their transgender cohort Bernadette—as they take their show to the middle of the desert.
“Priscilla excites and challenges us with its huge array of music and dance, seamless choreographed set changes, and a fast-paced but nuanced story of love and acceptance,” said Davies.
The cast includes a W&L students Lauren Hoaglund ’22, Grace Pelosky ’22,  Keren Katz ’22, Mike Bracey ’20, Dan Wetterhahn ’21, Simon Marland ’20, Issac Rosenthal ’19, Matthew Gibson ’20L, and Harris Billings ’20. As well as community actors Nancy Johnston, Bill Stone, McKelvey and Liam Courtney-Collins, Lia Kennedy and Robb Zahm ’13L.
