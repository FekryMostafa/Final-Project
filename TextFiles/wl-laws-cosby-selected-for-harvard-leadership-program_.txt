Michelle Cosby, Assistant Dean of Legal Information Services and Professor of Practice has been selected to attend the Harvard Graduate School of Education Leadership Institute for Academic Librarians. The intensive one-week institute covers issues relevant to higher education including transformational change, contemporary leadership challenges, and diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.
“I am looking forward to connecting with other leaders in the profession and bringing back new ideas to W&L Law,” said Cosby.
Cosby joined W&L Law in June to lead the Law Library in its efforts to support the research needs of law faculty and students. In this role, she also oversees the daily operations including strategic directions, personnel, budget, and administrative activities for the library. Previously, Cosby was the Director of the Law Library at Temple University and Associate Director of the Law Library at the University of Tennessee.
Cosby served as the President of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL) from July 2019-July 2020, and is a Fastcase 50 Honoree.
