What you are looking forward to in 1L year?
Aside from exploring all that Lexington has to offer, I find myself excited to connect and build a tight-knit community with my fellow W&L Law peers as we collectively begin our legal journey.
Hobby/Interest?
I’m a lover of fitness classes, creative writing, and Chick-fil-A.
Why W&L Law?
I chose W&L Law because of its strong reputation for fostering a close-knit, supportive community of faculty and law students. I have experienced firsthand the beauty of having one-to-one support during college as well as in my role working as a tax accountant. As such, I knew that I just had to be at a law school where that same kind of support is available to me and I’m seen as a name, not simply a number. W&L Law stands out as that place.
