The Washington and Lee School of Law Black Law Students Association (BLSA) moot court teams have advanced to nationals following top finishes at the Mid-Atlantic Black Law Students Association (MABLSA) competitions, held Feb. 15-19 in Philadelphia.
The team of Charisma Hunter ‘23L and Kobie Crosley ‘23L took first place in the competition and also took top honors with the Best Petitioner Brief award. Law students Jasmine Cooper ‘24L and Tom Boss ‘24L finished third overall as a team and won the top award for Best Respondent Brief. In addition, Boss was named the competition’s top oral advocate.
Both teams will now advance to the national competition, to be held in Arlington, VA in March. The competition occurs during the annual conference of the National Black Law Students Association. In addition to hosting the competitions, the regional and national conferences serve as an opportunity for students to network with other students as well as practitioners and potential employers.
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
