K.T. Vaughan, The Hal F. and Barbra Buckner Higginbotham University Librarian at W&L, was elected president of the Virginia Library Association (VLA) in October 2021.
VLA is the primary statewide professional association for public, academic and special librarians and libraries in Virginia. It is one of the largest professional library associations in the country, with just under 5,000 members.
Vaughan’s scholarly research interests focus on asking questions about – and driving change in – the future of libraries. She is currently focused on building inclusive and equitable library environments for people with disabilities, scholarly and digital communication in resource-constrained contexts, and the career advancement and professionalism of library staff and faculty. Her dissertation, “Building an Inclusive Library through Staff Accessibility Training,” is available via the James Madison University and Arizona State University institutional repositories.
Vaughan is a member of the American Library Association and the Association of College and Research Librarians. She is the author of numerous articles in professional journals and has presented her work at conferences around the country.
If you know a W&L faculty member who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
