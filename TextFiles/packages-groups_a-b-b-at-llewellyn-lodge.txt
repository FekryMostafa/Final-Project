Flyfishing is one of the most enjoyable ways to experience the outdoors these days and we offer the perfect venues for beginners or seasoned veterans to enjoy all the things that make it so special. 
Our half-day Introduction to Flyfishing trip to mountain pond setting is one option of the package and covers all aspects of the sport in a fun, hands-on learning way to get you started. All equipment is provided. Near the end of this trip, you put your newly learned skills to work as you try to catch some colorful, high-energy Rainbow & Brook. We recommend this for couples, father-sons, mother-daughters, grandparents, wedding parties, reunion groups—you name it. Stream Trips for more experienced anglers are available. I also offer a Combo Trip which includes my Beginner trip of 4 hours and afterwards, a trip to a Blue-Ribbon Trophy Trout stream. All equipment & lunch is provided.
