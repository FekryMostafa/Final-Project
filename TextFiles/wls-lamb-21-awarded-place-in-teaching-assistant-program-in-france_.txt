Washington and Lee University senior Olivia Lamb has been offered a place in the Teaching Assistant Program in France (TAPIF). At W&L, Lamb is majoring in business administration with a minor in French.
The program offers students the opportunity to work in France for seven months, teaching English to French students of all ages. Each year, more than 1,500 Americans are selected by TAPIF to teach in public schools across all regions of metropolitan France. Lamb is awaiting her specific city and school assignment, but she knows she will be based in the Bordeaux region.
“I am honored and excited to have been chosen for this program. It has been a dream of mine to be able to speak French and live on my own in France since middle school,” Lamb said. “This is literally a dream come true.”
On campus, Lamb serves as a Rho Gamma, or recruitment guide, for freshman girls going through Greek Life recruitment, and she is the chief external affairs officer and fundraising director of Kappa Alpha Theta. She is also a member of the Triathlon Club.
“I am still figuring out what is going to be next for me after this program,” Lamb said. “I am open to creating relationships and exploring opportunities while I am in France, and I will see what happens from there.”
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
