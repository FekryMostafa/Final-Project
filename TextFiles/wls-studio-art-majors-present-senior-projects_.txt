This year’s show features work by Ryan Brink, Audrey Dangler, Sara Dotterer, Jessie Drennen, Ellen Kanzinger, Leigh Poetzsch, Hayley Price, McKenna Quatro, Ruth Smith and Amberly Wang.
Staniar Gallery is located on the second floor of Wilson Hall, in Washington and Lee University’s Lenfest Center for the Arts. Gallery hours are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. For more information, call 540-458-8861.
