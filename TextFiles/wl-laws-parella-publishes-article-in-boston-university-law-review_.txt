Washington and Lee law professor Kish Parella has published an article in the Boston University Law Review. The article, “Contractual Stakeholderism,” examines the corporate purpose debate through the lens of contract design and harm to third parties.
“When corporations act in the world, the consequences of their actions do not fall only on the corporate leaders who made the decision or the shareholders whose investments may consequently rise or fall. Instead, corporate activity has a long reach, casting a shadow over a corporation’s many stakeholders, such as employees, consumers, communities, suppliers, and more. The question is: ‘Whose interests should a corporation serve?’,” writes Parella.
The article is available online at the Boston University Law Review website.
