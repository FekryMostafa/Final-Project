Washington and Lee University's new Japanese Tea Room was named Senshin'an 洗心庵 "Clearing-the-Mind Abode" by Sen Genshitsu, 15th-generation Grand Master of the Urasenke Tradition of Tea. This architectural treasure was built in the Watson Galleries on campus, where it serves as a classroom laboratory for the study of Chanoyu 茶の湯, or the Way of Tea, and a center for cultural activities relating to the arts of Japan.  
W&L students, who are interested in taking the LIT course on "Food and Tea in Japan" should contact Professor Ikeda at ikedaj@wlu.edu.  If your group is interested in scheduling a tea ceremony demonstration, please contact J. Ikeda at the email address above or Tel. 540-458-8936.
