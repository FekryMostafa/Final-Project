What you are looking forward to in 1L year?
I look forward to conquering 1L year with my fellow peers, while finally being able to persue a childhood dream.
Hobby/Interest?
I enjoy reading, baking, and absolutely love listening to podcasts, especially true crime.
Why W&L Law?
After touring several other law schools, none of them quite felt like home. However, when I stepped foot on the campus of Washington and Lee University School of Law, I immediately knew this was where I would begin my law school journey.
