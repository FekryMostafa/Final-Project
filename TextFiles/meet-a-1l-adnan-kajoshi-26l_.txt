Why W&L Law?
The emphasis on community ultimately made me so excited to attend W&L. The employment outcomes and national alumni network of W&L Law has already impressed me, but environment and feel were aspects that were just as important to me. These are aspects that can only be experienced in person. When I finally visited Lexington and got a tangible feel of the environment, it did not take me long to decide that this was a community that I wanted to be a part of and actively involved in.
