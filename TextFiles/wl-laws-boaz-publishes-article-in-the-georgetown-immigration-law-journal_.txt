Washington and Lee law professor Matt Boaz has published an article in the Georgetown Immigration Law Journal. The article, “Speculative Immigration Policy,” explores how speculative fiction could serve as a platform for radical imagination about future U.S. immigration policies.
“Speculative fiction creates an opportunity to engage with ideas that might otherwise be ‘third rails’ such as the abolition of various policing forces, critiques of sovereignty, and open borders. Speculative fiction can, therefore, provide a secure realm within which one can be free to explore ideas that they might otherwise feel prohibited from considering…. [E]ngaging with speculative fiction written by authors from marginalized backgrounds can help to shift both individual and institutional perceptions about what bold reconstructive policy changes might be possible,” writes Boaz.
The article is available online at the W&L Scholarly Commons.
