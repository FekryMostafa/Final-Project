The Washington and Lee Journal of Civil Rights and Social Justice will host its annual symposium on Thursday, Oct. 29 and Friday, Oct 30. The event will be hosted on Zoom. Registration is available here: https://wlu.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3_F6583eTaiu3e-w0cPTsg
Symposium organizers note that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected and harmed people of color. The event will explore these harms and continue ongoing conversations about the racial inequity that COVID-19 has exposed, exacerbated, and created.
The panels will cover a wide range of issues related to the pandemic and racial inequity in health care, environmental justice, criminal justice, poverty and finance, civil liberties, and education. A schedule is below. Visit https://jcrsj.wlulaw.io/2020-symposium-race-and-the-pandemic/ for more information and updates.
