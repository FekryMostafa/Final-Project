The Washington and Lee School of Law team of Alexis Acosta, Simon Ciccarillo, and Christian Sanchez Leon participated recently in the 29th Annual Uvaldo Herrera National Moot Court Competition conducted by the Hispanic National Bar Association.
The team, all third-year law students and members of the school’s Latin American Law Students Association (LALSA), competed against teams from 32 other law schools. Advancing to the quarter finals, the team finished in the top 8 in the oral argument portion of the competition. The students were awarded first place overall for submitting the best petitioner brief.
The law firm of Seyfarth Shaw wrote the competition problem, in part based on Untied States v. Rahimi,  a case currently before the Supreme Court. The problem probed important questions around the developing area of Second Amendment law, and specifically whether a domestic abuser under a civil restraining order still possesses the right to firearms.
The competition took place at the U.S. District Court in Seattle. In winning the best petitioner brief award, the students brought home a $3,500 scholarship award for the school.
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
