The Honor System is the foundation from which we start our community at Washington & Lee and its administration is overseen by the Executive Committee of the Student Body.  It has defined and shaped the students, alumni and faculty of this institution for well over a century.  Here you can learn about the history, philosophy and procedure of the honor system, as well as public notices regarding recent cases.
Student Self-Governance is a key aspect of Washington & Lee and is overseen by the Executive Committee.  Here you can get a copy of the student body constitution; learn about current student body issues through the minutes of our weekly business meetings; view a list of current Executive Committee task forces; and obtain information about elections and the Voting Regulations Board.
