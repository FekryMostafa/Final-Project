Two graduates of Washington and Lee School of Law have been honored recently for their pro bono work.
Amy Conant Hoang ‘13L, an associate at K&L Gates in Washington, DC, was one of four attorneys nationwide to be honored by the non-profit Tahirih Justice Center. The Center was founded in 1997 to provide legal services to immigrant women and children who are escaping violent situations. Hoang worked to get her client a grant of asylum in the U.S.
At K&L Gates, Hoang is member of the firm’s government contracts and procurement policy group. She advises clients in the aerospace, defense, and government services industries on a variety of procurement issues, and concentrates her practice on bid protests at the Government Accountability Office and Court of Federal Claims, corporate ethics and compliance, and internal investigations.
Also honored was Krystal Swendsboe ‘15L, who was recognized by her firm Wiley Rein at the firm’s sixth annual pro bono celebration. Swendsboe contributed to a host of appellate pro bono matters including amicus briefs and two merits matters before the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Ninth Circuits.
At Wiley Rein, Swendsboe represents corporate clients and individuals in a variety of litigation and appellate matters in state and federal courts. She has served in legal capacities in both public and private entities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and federal trial and appellate courts.
