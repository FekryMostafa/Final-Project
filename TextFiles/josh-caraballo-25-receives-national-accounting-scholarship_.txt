Washington and Lee University junior Josh Caraballo ’25 received a scholarship from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to support his plans to pursue a career in accounting. An accounting and art history double major from Dingmans-Ferry, Pennsylvania, Caraballo was one of 369 students from colleges and universities across the United States to be selected for the $10,000 scholarship.
“Congratulations to all those named PCAOB Scholars this year,” said PCAOB Chair Erica Y. Williams. “Having talented and diverse people enter accounting and auditing is key to the future of investor protection, and we are proud that our PCAOB Scholars Program helps outstanding individuals, such as this group of students, along this career path.”
Established in 2011, the PCAOB Scholars Program is designed to benefit outstanding students who are likely to become auditors, and the PCAOB encourages participating colleges and universities to give special consideration to students from underrepresented populations within the accounting profession when nominating scholarship candidates. Since the program’s inception, the PCAOB has awarded $22.42 million in scholarships to more than 2,000 recipients, with this year’s cohort being the largest number of recipients in the program’s history.
“Being nominated for – and receiving – this scholarship means a lot because it is a vote of confidence from the faculty members in the Department of Accounting here at W&L,” Caraballo said. “This scholarship will make it easier for me to obtain the necessary education requirements for the CPA exam and continue my career path.”
On campus, Caraballo is a member of the W&L Wind Ensemble and works at the Marketplace.
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
