Internships and Fellowships
A full college education cannot exist within the walls of a classroom alone. That’s why we encourage and support students who decide to pursue nationally competitive scholarships, internships and fellowships.



Preparing Your Path
Students benefit from personal attention from early career exploration to post-grad preparation. On-campus programming, career trips, and a supportive alumni network, ensure students have the confidence, skills and tools to pursue their professional paths.



The Alumni Network
W&L is home away from home for students who have their own unique interests and aspirations. Here, you join an engaged, welcoming community of individuals who often become friends for life.
