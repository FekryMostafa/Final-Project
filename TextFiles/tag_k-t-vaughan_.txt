The Human Library, a collaboration between the Mudd Center for Ethics and Leyburn Library, brought the W&L community together in conversation.
Membership in HathiTrust allows the W&L community to access millions of digital books that the university does not have in print in the Leyburn, Telford or Law libraries.
The Washington and Lee University library is working to preserve documents relating to COVID-19 and diversity and inclusion discussions.
