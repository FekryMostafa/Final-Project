On Friday, September 8, the Washington and Lee Law Review will hold its annual celebration of student scholarship, the Student Notes Colloquium. The free event will be held in Millhiser Moot Court Room, Sydney Lewis Hall beginning at 4:00 pm.
Each year, the Law Review staff writers, as second-year law students, write a legal article on an issue of current interest in the law. The editorial board of the Law Review evaluates the submission, choosing the two most outstanding notes to receive awards the following year. This year’s winners are Fenja Schick-Malone ‘24L and Jordan Hicks ‘24L.
Hicks was awarded the Roy L. Steinheimer Law Review Award for his note “Judicial-ish Efficiency: An Analysis of Alternative Dispute Resolution Programs in Delaware Superior Court.” Prof. Benjamin Davis of W&L Law and R. Stokes Nolte, a long-time Delaware practitioner and partner at Wilks Law in Wilmington, DE, will provide commentary on Hick’s work.
Schick-Malone received the W&L Law Council Law Review Award for her note “Letting the Kids Run Wild: Free-Range Parenting and the (De)Regulation of Child Protective Services.” Commentary on her work will be provided by Prof. David Pimentel of the University of Idaho College of Law and Prof. Alan Trammell of W&L Law.
These articles, along with other student notes, will be published in Volume 80.3 of the W&L Law Review and will also be available online at https://lawreview.wlulaw.wlu.edu/.
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
