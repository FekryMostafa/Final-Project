Bob Strong, the William Lyne Wilson Professor of Political Economy at Washington and Lee University, and Frank Settle, professor emeritus of chemistry, have written a commentary about the nuclear age that was published in The Roanoke Times.
In the piece, Strong and Settle reflect on the start of the nuclear age and what has transpired since. They also touch on the extraordinary power of nuclear weapons and the challenges of teaching college students about “the interaction of the powers of science and the frailties of man.”
Read the entire piece in The Roanoke Times.
