The scholarship of W&L law professor Brandon Hasbrouck was among the most downloaded from the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) in 2022. His work was downloaded nearly 13,500 times during the year, placing him 16th on a list combining scholars from all categories of legal research. He placed tenth in downloads for U.S. law professors.
Hasbrouck is a prolific writer, with six scholarly articles published in the last year alone, and he also contributes a regular column to the Boston Globe commentary feature “The Emancipator.” His recent articles include “Movement Judges” in the New York University Law Review, “Reimagining Public Safety” in the Northwestern Law Review, “On Lenity: What Justice Gorsuch Didn’t Say” in the Virginia Law Review, “Movement Constitutionalism” in the Oklahoma Law Review, “The Antiracist Constitution” in the Boston University Law Review, and “Who Can Protect Black Protest?” in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review Online.
Hasbrouck’s research explores the legal and constitutional principles available to Congress and the courts to redress the ways law fails Black and other marginalized people and the structural possibilities for radical change in American society. His scholarship and advocacy work centers movements and works in solidarity with those movements to advance transformative understandings of our Constitution.
Links to Hasbrouck’s work is available on his SSRN page and in the W&L Law Scholarly Commons.
