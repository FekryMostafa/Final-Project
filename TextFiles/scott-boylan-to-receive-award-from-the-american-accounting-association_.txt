Scott Boylan, professor of accounting at Washington and Lee University, has been selected as one of two recipients of the 2023 Accounting Historians Journal Award of Excellence presented by the Academy of Accounting Historians section of the American Accounting Association (AAA). Boylan will be recognized for his award at the 2024 AAA annual meeting held Aug. 10-14 in Washington, D.C.
Boylan was cited for his paper “Charles J. Hirsch, Controller, Golden Nugget Casino: Rolling the Dice on Statistical Sampling and Analysis,” which appeared in the December 2023 issue of the Accounting Historians Journal.
“I am honored and humbled that the Academy of Accounting Historians chose to recognize this work,” said Boylan. “It was a privilege to share Hirsch’s story; that of a bookkeeper in a Las Vegas gambling joint in the 1950s, who helped push the accounting profession into the modern era of quantitative analysis and data analytics. I appreciate that both the university and the Williams School value and support this research, which I hope makes a small contribution to W&L’s liberal arts tradition.”
Boylan has been a member of the W&L faculty since 1999. He holds a Bachelor of Science in business administration and a Ph.D. in accounting from The Ohio State University. He also earned a Master of Accountancy from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
If you know a W&L faculty member who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
