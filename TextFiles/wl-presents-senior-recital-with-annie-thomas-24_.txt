The performance is free and open to the public and will be streamed online at https://go.wlu.edu/livestream.
Thomas will perform solo and collaborative works ranging from the classical to the modern period. The program features Samuel Barber’s “Excursions,” Peter Warlock’s “Capriol Suite,” and Ludwig van Beethoven’s “An die ferne Geliebte” accompanied by tenor Scott Williamson, visiting assistant professor of music at W&L.
Thomas has studied applied piano under the direction of Akiko Konishi, assistant professor of music at W&L, and her music major adviser is Shane Lynch, professor of music and director of choral activities. In addition to her piano studies, Thomas is a member of W&L’s choral conducting mentorship program and has sung and conducted in all three W&L choirs. She has also studied organ under the direction of Martha Burford, music director at Grace Episcopal Church in Lexington, and collaborates with Lacey Lynch, lecturer in music at W&L, as assistant director of the Rockbridge Youth Chorale.
Outside of her musical studies, Thomas is a member of the Campus Kitchen leadership team, a student intern in the Campus Garden, and works as a peer counselor. In 2023, she was awarded a nationally competitive Beinecke Scholarship, which she plans to use to fund her graduate studies in choral conducting.
