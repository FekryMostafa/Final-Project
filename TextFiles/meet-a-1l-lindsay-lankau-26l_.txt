What are you looking forward to in 1L year?
I am looking forward to focusing on studies that interest me as well as acquainting myself with the small town of Lexington and all of my classmates!
Hobby/Interest?
Traveling, reading, and watching the Vols win!!
Why W&L Law?
When I first came to Lexington, I was enamored with the small town and close knit community. Through my communications with the Admissions Office, I could tell that instead of being viewed as just another applicant, they truly cared about having me at the school. I am beyond excited to start at W&L and meet everyone in the Class of 2026!
