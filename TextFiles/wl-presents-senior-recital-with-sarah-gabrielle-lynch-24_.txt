Sarah Gabrielle Lynch ’24 will perform her senior soprano recital on April 6 at 8 p.m. in Wilson Concert Hall in the Lenfest Center for the Performing Arts. Lynch is a music and cognitive and behavioral science double major from Lower Gwynedd, Pennsylvania.
The performance is free and open to the public and will be streamed online at https://go.wlu.edu/livestream.
Lynch’s performance will include selections in English, French, German, Italian and Russian, and she will be accompanied on piano by Anna Billias, lecturer in music at W&L. The program features opera arias from Antonio Vivaldi and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, selections from Sergei Rachmaninoff and Max Reger themed around flowers and nature, Richard Strauss’s “Die Nacht,” Claude Debussy’s vocal setting of “Claire de Lune,” and will close with Jacques Offenbach’s aria “Les Oiseaux dans la charmille,” also known as the “Doll Aria.”
Lynch has studied under Christine Fairfield, lecturer in music, and has sung with Cantatrici, Glee Club, and the University Singers during her time at W&L. She is a member of the choral conducting mentorship program, works with the Rockbridge Youth Chorale as a student intern conductor, and appeared as Belinda in W&L’s 2024 Robert O. and Elizabeth M. Bentley opera production “Dido and Aeneas.” Through her cognitive and behavioral science studies, Lynch has gained insight into the functions and learning processes of the human mind and body, which she can apply to her current and future work with conducting, performance and voice instruction.
Outside of her musical studies, Lynch is involved in the Women in Technology and Science group on campus, mentors younger students in W&L’s choirs, and was a member of the W&L cheerleading team for two years. Following graduation, Lynch will pursue performance opportunities in opera before attending graduate school for vocal performance and conducting.
