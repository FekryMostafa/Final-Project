The History Department at Washington and Lee University is sponsoring a public panel in response to Michael Anton’s Constitution Day lecture on Sept. 25, at 5 p.m., in Hillel 101.
The panel discussion, which is free and open to the public, is titled “Who Is America?! A Response to Michael Anton’s Constitution Day Lecture.”
The panelists will share their expertise on the Constitution, the law and immigration. Panelist members include Kameliya Atanasova, assistant professor of religion, David Baluarte, associate clinical professor of law and director of Immigrants Rights Clinic, and Mohamed Kamara, associate professor of romance languages.
Michael Anton is a former deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications on the United States National Security Council. He also is a former speechwriter for Rudy Giuliani and George W. Bush’s National Security Council and has worked as director of communications at Citigroup and as managing director of BlackRock.
His Constitution Day lecture is Sept. 18 and Anton will give remarks about constitutional self-government and the Trump presidency.
“While no doubt Anton has interesting experiences to relate as a former White House staffer, his writings are also notable for their xenophobia, hostility to Islam and birthright citizenship,” said Sarah Horowitz, associate professor of history. “We organized this event so that members of the community could get an alternative perspective, ones more rooted in facts about Islam and immigration and a historically and legally grounded understanding of the Constitution.”
The event will be to view on  Livestream at https://livestream.com/wlu/who-is-america
