On the Fields of Gold Farm Trail, you’ll discover the home-grown side of Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley. Pick your own fruit in one of the orchards, stroll through a farmers’ market, savor a wine tasting, tour a working farm, celebrate at a farm festival, or feast on a locally-grown meal at one of our farm-to-table restaurants.
