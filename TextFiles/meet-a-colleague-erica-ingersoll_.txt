Q. Where is your favorite location on the W&L campus?
The courtyard in the middle of the law school. Despite being literally in the middle of everything, it is usually a calm and peaceful spot.
Q. What is your favorite thing to do when you are not working?
Be outside – whether it’s gardening therapy in my backyard, time with family and friends sitting on the patio listening to music and eating meals we have prepared together, or taking walks with our dog.
Q. Book/Podcast/TV Show Recommendation?
A recent favorite book, Untamed by Glennon Doyle. I was able to listen to the audio version on a long drive, read by the author, and found myself laughing and commenting out loud and even shedding a few tears. My most recent favorite TV show has been the newest season of Lincoln Lawyer.
Q. Who inspires you?
My kids! They are such neat people and I feel so blessed to be a part of their world.
Q. If you could have coffee or tea with one person, who would it be and why?
That’s a tough question. There are so many interesting people out in the world and lots of loved ones that I would appreciate more time with, but right now I think I would have to say Glennon Doyle. I have more questions after hearing her story and she seems very brave to me.
Q. Favorite food/restaurant/drink?
Tomatoes from our garden, fresh mozzarella, basil and a balsamic vinegar that we found at a farmers’ market. Yum!
Q. Most used/enjoyable app on your phone?
Spotify.
