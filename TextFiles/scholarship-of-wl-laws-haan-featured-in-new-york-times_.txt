Scholarship by W&L Law professor Sarah Haan on sexism in corporate governance was featured recently in a commentary by New York Times business and economic columnist Peter Coy.
Coy interviewed Haan and cites extensively from her Stanford Law Review article “Corporate Governance and the Feminization of Capital,” which explores the largely forgotten history women played as corporate shareholders and details their early fights for inclusion on corporate boards. Coy also relies on Haan’s forthcoming Southern California Law Review article, “Voting Rights in Corporate Governance: History and Political Economy.” In this article, Haan shows how the voting-rights framework that was cemented by the end of the nineteenth century—the framework that would go on to define twentieth-century corporate control—was determined by the interrelation of three evolving sets of legal rules and that shifts along these same “fault lines” have led to the present moment, where shareholder rights are again in flux.
Coy’s article is available online at the New York Times website.
