Aljazeera recently published two “explainer”  articles examining the definition of war crimes and genocide. The news outlet relied on the expertise of Washington and Lee law professor Mark Drumbl to produce the explainers.
On the question of why war crimes often go unpunished, Drumbl said “this can be attributed to several factors, including difficulties in obtaining evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, high requirements such as proving intention and, most importantly, power politics. The limits of international and national courts in terms of reach and jurisdiction are also a consideration, as is the reality the victors of conflict are often in control of questions over post-war justice.”
