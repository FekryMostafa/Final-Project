Washington and Lee law professor Brandon Hasbrouck ’11L has published a commentary in the Richmond Times-Dispatch arguing that any new justices on the U.S. Supreme Court must embrace a color-conscious perspective in order to address inequity in the criminal justice system.
“While Supreme Court justices are capable of introspection and independent thought, each of them does so in the context of their previous experiences. When those experiences so heavily run toward government interests in our racist criminal justice system, the odds firmly are stacked against (typically Black and Brown) criminal defendants. If we pack the court with more justices like these, we can expect more of the same.”
