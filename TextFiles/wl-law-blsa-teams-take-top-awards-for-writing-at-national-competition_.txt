The Washington and Lee School of Law Black Law Students Association (BLSA) sent two moot court teams to the annual competition and conference for the National Black Law Students Association, held March 7-12 in Arlington, VA.
The team of Charisma Hunter ‘23L and Kobie Crosley ‘23L were recognized with the Best Petitioner Brief award. Law students Jasmine Cooper ‘24L and Tom Boss ‘24L won the top award for Best Respondent Brief.
The W&L teams received support this year from several coaches, including Noriya Shahadat ’21L, who was able to join the teams at the conference. In addition to hosting the competitions, the national conference serves as an opportunity for students to network with other students as well as practitioners and potential employers.
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
