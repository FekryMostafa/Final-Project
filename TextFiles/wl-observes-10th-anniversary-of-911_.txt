Rev. John Talley, minister of the Reformed University Fellowship (RUF), told those gathered at a prayer vigil in memory of the 9/11 terror attacks on Sunday morning in front of Lee Chapel that the events 10 years ago represent an opportunity to change as individuals.
The prayer vigil was sponsored by W&L’s College Democrats and College Republicans and was one of two events scheduled to commemorate the 10th anniversary of 9/11. The second event, a panel discussion, will be held on Tuesday, Sept. 13, at 7 p.m. in the Hillel House multipurpose room. The panelists will be Ayse Zarakol, assistant professor of politics; Mark Drumbl, the Class of 1975 Alumni Professor of Law and director of the Transnational Law Clinic; and Bob Strong, the William Lyne Wilson Professor of Politics and interim provost.
The panel is open to the public.
Addressing a group of students, faculty, alumni and community members, Talley said that there is considerable talk about the way that 9/11 changed us as a country, but that he wanted to focus on how it changed us as individuals.
“How has it changed the way you think about terrorism? About the way you think about our country, as a people divided or united? How you think about political issues? How has it changed how you think about religious and spiritual issues? Has it changed the way you think about people who don’t think the way you think?” he asked.
“As I was thinking about all of these questions for my own life, I was struck that if we, as individuals and as a country, fail to miss this opportunity to reflect on those personal questions, we have missed a great opportunity to see change in our own lives, not just as a country but as individuals.”
Two Washington and Lee University alumni were killed in the 9/11 attacks — Commander Robert Allen Schlegel, of the Class of 1985, at the Pentagon and James A. Gadiel, of the Class of 2000, at the World Trade Center.
