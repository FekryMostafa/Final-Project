Sarah Horowitz, associate professor of history at Washington and Lee University, recently authored a new book titled “The Red Widow: The Scandal That Shook Paris and the Woman Behind It All.”
According to the book’s description on Goodreads, the book is a “rollicking historical account of Marguerite Steinheil, a real-life French femme fatale who used her influence to arrange governmental appointments, blackmailed her opponents and may have even attempted to poison those who got in the way of her agenda. Steinheil also mysteriously survived a home invasion that left her husband and mother dead, leaving the police with more questions than answers.”
The book is available for preorder now and is scheduled for public release in September 2022. Reserve a copy online here.
