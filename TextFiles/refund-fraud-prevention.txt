As tax refund fraud becomes more widespread, we’re working with taxpayers, tax professionals, employers, and payroll providers to help prevent it. 
To make sure that refunds go to the rightful owners, we’re committed to taking the time needed to carefully review all individual income tax returns we receive. 
We use an automated system that reviews returns for suspicious activity or possible fraud. If your return is selected for additional review, our Refund Review Team manually reviews the return and may send you a letter requesting additional information. 
If your return is selected for review, it will take longer to receive your refund. However, our goal is to stop fraudulent refunds before they’re issued, not to slow down your refund.
Steps you can take to help us process your return smoothly.
We issue personal identification numbers (PINs) to taxpayers identified as possible victims of identity theft. These PINs are another way for us to verify a taxpayer's identity when they file. As refund tax fraud schemes grow more elaborate, we continue to coordinate with the IRS, other state tax departments, and the tax software industry to protect your personal information and reduce refund fraud.
