One of the most popular day hikes in Virginia is Crabtree Falls. It is approximately 12 miles from us off the Blue Ridge Parkway near milepost 27. Crabtree Falls is the highest vertical-drop cascading waterfall east of the Mississippi River with a series of five major cascades among smaller ones that fall a total distance of 1,200 feet. This adventure is one of our most memorable getaway packages. The first overlook is a short distance from the parking lot and follows a gentle meandering paved trail. Continue walking along a 3-mile path to four other overlooks with spectacular views. From the upper falls, the trail follows the creek another 1.2 miles to Crabtree Meadows. There is a daily $3 parking fee per vehicle at the public parking area. Our Crabtree Falls Package includes:
