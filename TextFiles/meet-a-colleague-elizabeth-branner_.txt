Q. Where is your favorite location on the W&L campus?
It’s hard to choose one – the Law Lawn on a sunny day, Liberty Hall ruins with the beautiful view, Woods Creek with the sounds of the flowing water, the magnificence of the Colonnade, the bountiful nature of the back campus trails.
Q. What is your favorite thing to do when you are not working?
Hanging out on the Eastern Shore of Virginia in Cape Charles, VA – biking, crabbing, and boating.
Q. Book/Podcast/TV Show Recommendation?
“Being Mortal” by Atul Gawande and “Hero with a Thousand Faces” by Joseph Campbell.
Q. Who inspires you?
My deceased aunts, Nancy Outland Chandler and Jean Outland Chrysler, who were powerful women ahead of their time.
Q. If you could have coffee or tea with one person, who would it be and why?
My mother, who died suddenly six years ago. I would love to see her again.
Q. What is an accomplishment you are proud of?
The resources we have raised and the alumni we have engaged in Law School Advancement over the past 25 years.
Q. Favorite food/restaurant/drink?
My favorite food group is seafood (blue crabs, oysters, fish, scallops). My favorite drink is my Uncle Franklin’s Egg Nog, which I make every Christmas. Southern Inn was my favorite restaurant—RIP.
Q. Most used/enjoyable app on your phone?
Instagram because it makes me laugh, especially the reels with animals and small children.
