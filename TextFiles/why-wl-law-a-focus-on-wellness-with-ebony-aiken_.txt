The first day that I came here was for the Orientation Week. And Dean Wilson had a conversation with the Class of 2025. And she kept talking about grit and resiliency, she kept talking about the key to being a great lawyer is having balance, is being able to find time to do the things you love so that way you can give your all to the things that you need to do. And hearing that come from the Dean of the entire law school reaffirmed to me that she sees our humanity and she understands our holistic needs. And so it was consistent with what I had seen in the admissions process that talked about wellness and wholeness. To have them pouring [that] into me from day one made me feel like, “Okay, I can do this.” No one is going to condemn me for wanting to go to the movies or needing to go to a yoga class or anything like that because that’s expected.
