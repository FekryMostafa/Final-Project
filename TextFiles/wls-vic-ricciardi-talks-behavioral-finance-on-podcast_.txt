Victor Ricciardi, visiting assistant professor of finance at Washington and Lee University, served as an expert panelist on behavioral finance and retirement planning for the podcast “That Annuity Show” earlier this year.
The show’s title was “Building a Vision of a Better Future Self in a Very Stressed World.” In the episode, panelists discussed what they already know from the study of behavioral finance and applied their knowledge to a “post-COVID world.” Ricciardi and the other panelists discussed creating new positive visions for retirement using conventional approaches despite the challenge created by a socially distant environment.
