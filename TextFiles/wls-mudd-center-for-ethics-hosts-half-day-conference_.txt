Washington and Lee University’s Mudd Center for Ethics will host a half-day conference on March 12 from 2:30 – 6 p.m. in Stackhouse Theater. The conference is part of the center’s series on The Ethics of Technology.
The conference is titled “Ethics and Technology: Surveillance, Civil Rights, and Cyber-Security.” It is free and open to the public.
There will be two panel discussions: the first is Current Issues in Cyber Security and the second will cover Facial Recognition Technology and Civil Rights Issues.
Panelist include Margaret Hu, associate professor of law at W&L; Merrit Baer, Amazon web services; Davi Ottenheimer, Inrupt; Scott Shackelford, associate professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University; Clare Garvie, senior associate at Georgetown University Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology; Simone Browne, associate professor of African and African Diaspora Studies at the University of Texas; and Mark Rush, Waxberg Professor of Politics at W&L.
The Mudd Center was established in 2010 through a gift to the university from award-winning journalist Roger Mudd, a 1950 graduate of W&L. When he made his contribution, Mudd said that “given the state of ethics in our current culture, this seems a fitting time to endow a center for the study of ethics, and my university is the fitting home.”
