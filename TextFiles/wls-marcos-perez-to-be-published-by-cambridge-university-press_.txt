Marcos Perez, assistant professor of sociology at Washington and Lee University has published a book about the unemployed workers’ movement in Argentina titled, “Proletarian Lives: Routines, Identity, and Culture in Contentious Politics” (Cambridge University Press, 2022).
According to the book’s description, ” ‘Proletarian Lives’ provides a case study of how workers affected by job loss protect their traditional forms of life by engaging in progressive grassroots mobilization. Using life-history interviews and participant observation, the book analyzes why some activists develop a strong attachment to the movement despite initial reluctance and frequent ideological differences.”
