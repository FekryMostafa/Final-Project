Washington and Lee visiting assistant law professor Alex Klein has published an article in the Florida Law Review. The article, “When Police Volunteer to Kill,” explores the potential consequences of using police officers as executioners in states that utilize firing squads.
“Relying on police officers as executioners will destabilize policing because it encourages negative aspects of policing culture and undermines officers’ ability to work within their communities. This practice also risks adding impermissible features to executions, further undermining the retributive justifications for capital punishment. Using police officers from the jurisdiction where the crime occurred has a significant association with retributive and expressive functions of punishment,” writes Klein.
The article is available online at the Florida Law Review website.
