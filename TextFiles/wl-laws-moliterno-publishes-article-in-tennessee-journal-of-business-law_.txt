Washington and Lee law professor James Moliterno, along with several coauthors, has published an article in Transactions: the Tennessee Journal of Business Law. The article, “Introducing Students to Ethics and Professionalism Challenges in Virtual Communication,” presents a variety of exercises that introduce students to client confidentiality, inadvertent disclosure, and other ethical issues that often arise in the context of virtual communication during a transaction. They also introduce professionalism issues common to transactional practice and explore the relationship between professionalism and ethical duties in transactional practice.
“As the practice of law, and the conduct of business generally, focuses increasingly on virtual communication, the ethics and professionalism challenges inherent in email, videoconference, text, and telephone communication continue to evolve. These challenges are particularly prevalent in transactional practice, which involves frequent communication with a variety of parties through a variety of communication channels. Exposing law students to these challenges through exercises and simulations contributes to the continued development of their professional identity as lawyers,” Moliterno writes.
The article is available online at the Tennessee Journal of Business Law website.
