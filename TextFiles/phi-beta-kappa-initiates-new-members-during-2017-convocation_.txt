The Phi Beta Kappa chapter at Washington and Lee University welcomed 49 members of the junior and senior classes and seven graduates from the Class of 2016 into the prestigious honor society at the Phi Beta Kappa/Society of the Cincinnati Convocation on Sunday, March 19. All of the inductees were accepted into Phi Beta Kappa based on their exceptional academic achievements.

The chapter inducted as an honorary member Roger Jeans, Elizabeth Lewis Otey Professor of History Emeritus at W&L, in recognition of his longstanding commitment to scholarship and publication.
The chapter gave Henry C. Patrick III and Kathryn K. Osowski the Phi Beta Kappa J. Brown Goehring Sophomore Award, which honors J. Brown Goehring, a retired W&L professor of chemistry who, during his 38-year career at W&L, spent 22 years as secretary/treasurer of the University’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter.
This year’s initiates are:

Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary. Its motto is “Love of learning is the guide of life.”
