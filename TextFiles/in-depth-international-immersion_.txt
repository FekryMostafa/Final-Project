Many students contemplating their college experience look forward to studying abroad. At W&L, we provide our students the opportunity to take things even further. The Certificate of International Immersion recognizes students who demonstrate significant commitment to global interaction through significant time abroad spent in coursework, research, field work, internships or community service.
“The Certificate of International Immersion recognizes extraordinary accomplishments by students who have spent time abroad and who work to draw upon their experiences to contribute to the internationalization of our campus culture,” said Mark Rush, director of international education. “It provides an opportunity for the campus to recognize and appreciate these students who look not only to deepen their own educational experiences, but also to enrich our campus life.”
Since establishing the certificate in 2012, the University has recognized to 34 students based on their overall academic records and portfolios of international experiences. Meet some of the recipients from the Class of 2015 and discover where they went, how their travels informed their overall education, and how W&L supported their experiences.
