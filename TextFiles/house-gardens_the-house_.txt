Monticello is the autobiographical masterpiece of Thomas Jefferson—designed and redesigned and built and rebuilt for more than forty years—and its gardens were a botanic showpiece, a source of food, and an experimental laboratory of ornamental and useful plants from around the world.
A rich and varied collection of objects including art, furnishings, personal items, books, and manuscripts from Monticello's collections.
