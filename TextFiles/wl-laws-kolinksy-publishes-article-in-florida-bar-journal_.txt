Washington and Lee law professor Heather Kolinksy has published an article in the Florida Bar Journal. In the article, titled “Storytelling, The Sound of Music, And Special Teams: Revisiting Some Basic Legal Writing Techniques With Fresh Eyes,” Kolinsky discusses her return to teaching legal writing after spending time as an appellate attorney and federal law clerk. This article revisits three important parts of any trial memorandum or appellate brief: the statement of facts, case illustrations, and point headings.
“I haven’t thought about the “basics” of legal writing in a very long time. Instead, like many of us, it is something I do reflexively without really stopping to think about the steps I take while drafting motions, briefs, or orders. Being forced to think about how the parts become the whole has reminded me that revisiting the basics is a good way to refresh and reconsider the way we write every day,” writes Kolinsky.
The article is available online at the Florida Bar Journal website.
