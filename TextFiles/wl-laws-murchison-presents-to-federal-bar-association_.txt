Professor Brian Murchison joined Roanoke litigator Jay O’Keeffe in reviewing notable cases of the 2021 Supreme Court Term at a meeting of the Roanoke Chapter of the Federal Bar Association.  Hosting the event was Judge Robert S. Ballou.
Professor Murchison discussed four cases involving the Court’s much-noted development of a “major questions doctrine” in interpreting federal statutes.  Murchison focused on Alabama Association of Realtors v. HHS, 141 S.Ct. 2485 (2021), National Federation of Independent Business v. OSHA, 142 S.Ct. 661 (2022), Biden v. Missouri, 142 S.Ct. 647 (2022), and West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S.Ct. 2587 (2022).
Mr. O’Keeffe, a partner at MichieHamlett and publisher of DeNovo: A Virginia Appellate Law Blog, reviewed three other key cases from the 2021 Term:  Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 142 S.Ct. 2228 (2022) (overruling Roe v. Wade), Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, 142 S.Ct. 2407 (2022) (Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses protect “praying coach”), and Carson v. Makin, 142 S.Ct. 1987 (2022) (nonsectarian requirement for tuition assistance violated Free Exercise Clause).
