Washington and Lee University law school student Olivia Maier ‘24L has been named as the Distinguished Bankruptcy Law Student for the Fourth Circuit. Only one student from each of the eleven U.S. circuits receives this prestigious award.
The award is given by the American College of Bankruptcy to recognize and promote prospective leaders in the insolvency and bankruptcy profession. The criteria for the selection of the distinguished law students include academic excellence, professional accomplishments, commitment to public service, and extraordinary law school experience and familiarity with insolvency law.
Maier was nominated for the award by Judge Rebecca Connelly and her clerk Caleb Chaplain of the Western District of Virginia Bankruptcy Court. Maier interned for Judge Connelly during her 1L summer, and Caleb Chaplain acted as her note advisor during her 2L year as she wrote her article on the Texas Two-Step bankruptcy maneuver.
“As a part of winning the award I attended the College’s Annual Meeting which was a phenomenal experience,” said Maier. “Throughout the weekend I was able to attend panels, meet professionals at the top of their field, and receive invaluable advice that I will take with me as I enter the bankruptcy field.”
At W&L Law, Maier is the editor in chief of the Journal of Civil Rights and Social Justice. She has also served as a research assistant to Professors Kish Parella and Michell Drumbl. She will be clerking in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina upon graduation.
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
