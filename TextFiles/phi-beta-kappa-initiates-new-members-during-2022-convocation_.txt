The Phi Beta Kappa chapter at Washington and Lee University welcomed 57 members of the junior and senior classes into the prestigious honor society at the Phi Beta Kappa/Society of the Cincinnati Convocation on March 20. The honorees were inducted into Phi Beta Kappa based on their exceptional academic achievements. 
The convocation address, titled “Curiosity Got the Best of Me: Finding the Courage to Change Course,” was given by Vincent Kim ’14, who graduated with a degree in physics before attending the University of Cambridge on a Gates Cambridge scholarship. He is now a data science manager at Feedzai, a company that leverages machine learning to fight financial crime.  
The chapter inducted as an alumni member Dr. Jonathan Wortham ’04, medical epidemiologist in the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wortham has served on the W&L Science Advisory Board and the advisory board of the Shepherd Poverty Program and currently sits on the university’s Board of Trustees. 
Barbra Buckner Higginbotham was inducted as an honorary member in recognition of the support she and her husband, Hal Higginbotham ’68, have provided to the Leyburn Library, the Senshin’an Tearoom and the W&L Office of Inclusion and Diversity. Higginbotham earned her doctorate in library science from Columbia University. She served as a librarian at both Columbia University and Brooklyn College, where she became the executive director of Academic Information Technologies before her retirement in 2008. 
This year’s student initiates are: 
Class of 2022

Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary. Its motto is “Love of learning is the guide of life.”
