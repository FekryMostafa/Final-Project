Open Today – 8:30AM - 5:00PM
This 2.5 hour, small-group, guided, interactive tour has a specific focus on slavery at Monticello and its legacies. The tour begins on the mountaintop, with an exploration of the first floor of the house, surrounding grounds, and Mulberry Row through the perspectives of enslaved people who labored on the plantation. Guests return to the visitor center, where they will visit the Burial Ground for Enslaved People, and participate in a facilitated dialogue on race and the legacies of slavery in the United States. Guests on the tour are encouraged to share their own experiences and perspectives along the way.
This tour is held rain or shine and includes a fair amount of walking over some uneven terrain. Guests should plan to arrive at the visitor center 30 minutes prior to their tour start time to allow time to pass through a security screening and travel from the visitor center to the mountaintop.
A previous version of this tour was offered as the "Hemings Family Tour."
Note: not recommended for children under 12.
Guests are encouraged but no longer required to wear facial coverings at Monticello.
