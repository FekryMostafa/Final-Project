On what was once a working plantation, the paradox of slavery stands in stark relief to the ideals of liberty that Jefferson embedded in the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson owned 607 men, women, and children over the course of his lifetime. Archaeologists and historians have spent more than 50 years uncovering their stories and the footprint of plantation life at Monticello. Recent restoration has further revealed the history of slavery on the mountaintop. Explore the stories of remarkable families and individuals — free and enslaved — from over seven generations, through Monticello's tours, exhibitions, digital resources and special events.
Meet the individuals who lived and worked on Mulberry Row, once the industrial hub and center of work and domestic life for dozens of people, free and enslaved, at Thomas Jefferson’s 5,000-acre plantation.
