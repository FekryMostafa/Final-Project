The Museums at Washington and Lee announces that it is one of 56 institutions in the United States selected to participate in the Collections Assessment for Preservation (CAP) program.
CAP helps museums improve the care of their collections by providing support for a general conservation assessment of the museum’s objects and buildings. The museum will work with a team of preservation professionals to identify preventive conservation priorities. The final assessment report will help the museum prioritize its collections care efforts in the coming years.
“We are grateful for this opportunity to work with experts as we realize our goal of building capacity to deliver on our mission by improving conservation efforts to care for our rich collection of 13,000 objects,” said Isra El-beshir, director of the Museums at W&L. “We are also looking forward to using the assessment to pursue accreditation with the American Alliance of Museums.”
The CAP program is administered by the Foundation for Advancement in Conservation through a cooperative agreement with the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
The Museums at W&L are located at 214 N. Main St., Lexington, Virginia, with a mission to advance learning through direct engagement with the collections and facilitate an interdisciplinary appreciation of art, history and culture. It is open Wednesday to Friday, 11 a.m.-6 p.m., and Saturdays, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Learn more at wlu.edu/arts/museums.
