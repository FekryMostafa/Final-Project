Changes in four basic physical signs indicate an emergency situation. If one of these signs is out of normal range, call 911 immediately. If vital signs are slowing, do not wait - get emergency help! Remember CUPS:
Use the anonymous on-line crime reporting form to report bias based or "hate crimes."  The link also allows the anonymous reporting of other crimes including hazing and will assist in the annual Campus Security Act (Clery Act) reporting required by law. Information submitted via this link goes only to Public Safety. The identity of the reporting party will not be available to Public Safety or any other office in the University. Public Safety will make every effort to investigate the report, though in some cases it may be difficult to conduct a thorough investigation based only on an anonymous complaint.
