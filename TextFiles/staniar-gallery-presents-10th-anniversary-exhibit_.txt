The 2016-17 academic year marks the 10-year anniversary for Washington and Lee University’s Staniar Gallery.
To mark the occasion, Staniar Gallery will present a group exhibition featuring recent works by Studio Art faculty and W&L alumni who studied art in Wilson Hall and Staniar Gallery. “Decade: Staniar Gallery’s 10-Year Anniversary Exhibition” will be on view Sept. 30–Oct. 28.
There will be a reception for the artists on Oct. 22 at 4 p.m. The reception, held as part of the Young Alumni Weekend activities, will be co-hosted with the Music Department which is also celebrating its 10th year in Wilson Hall.
When the Department of Art and Art History moved to the newly constructed Wilson Hall in 2006, Staniar Gallery opened its doors with generous funding from distinguished Washington and Lee alumnus Burt Staniar, Class of 1964. With a mission to serve as a pedagogical exhibition space, Staniar Gallery has hosted over 70 shows in its first decade, enabling students to understand art in its cultural contexts. In addition to presenting contemporary and art historical works, the gallery provides programming to enhance the University’s liberal arts curriculum.
The exhibition will include work by W&L art professors Leigh Ann Beavers (printmaking), Christa Bowden (photography), Kathleen Olson (painting) and Larry Stene (sculpture).
Alumni who contributed artworks to the show include Ebony Bailey ’14; Greg Barton ’13; Kathy Brown ’11; Rosemary Hambright ’11; Amira Hegazy ’15; Alee Johnson ’15; Hikaru Kinouchi ’11; Clara McClenon ’10; Grace McGee ’10; Claire Moryan ’12; Michael O’Brien ’10; Will Paxton ’11; Nicki Ross ’15; Eileen Small ’15; Polly Smith ’08; and Lida Steves ’13.
Staniar Gallery is located on the second floor of Wilson Hall, in Washington and Lee University’s Lenfest Center for the Arts. Gallery hours are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, please call (540) 458-8861.
