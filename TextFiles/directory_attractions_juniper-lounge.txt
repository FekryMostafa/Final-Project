Hand-crafted cocktails, craft beer, wine, and a seasonally-inspired menu are the cornerstones of a great evening at Juniper Lounge at The Gin Hotel in Lexington. Overlooking Main Street, our second-floor veranda is a prime location for sunsets and savory summer night. It's the best outdoor seating in all of Lexington.
You'll notice a collection of plates on our menu that are meant for sharing. That's to allow everyone at your table to sample a morsel of goodness. Try a flight or half-pours to sample a variety of craft beers while you're here.
Open Thursday through Sunday
- Happy Hour from 3 to 5 p.m.
- Dinner and Bar available 5 to 9 p.m.
