Washington and Lee University’s award-winning Washington and Lee Repertory Dance Company will perform “W&L Dancers Create…” on Nov. 14 and 15 at 7 p.m. and Nov. 16 at 2 p.m. in the Lenfest Center.
The performance, which will be a collaborative, modern take on the four seasons, will take place under the artistic direction of professor Jenefer Davies. The performance is comprised of work choreographed, designed and performed by students, showcasing the diversity and talent within the department. It also features input from two guest artists who visited W&L during the semester to teach master classes and set new works for students.
“Bringing together professional guest artists, faculty and current students creates a beautiful synergy,” said Davies. “A palpable force of teaching and learning is created where people unite in a shared experience. Together they take risks, learn and grow as they collaborate in the artistic process.”
Students under the direction of Shawn Paul Evans, lighting designer and professor of theater, are using the performance as the practical culmination of a semester-long class containing lectures and smaller projects. The student choreographers and designers worked in tandem, learning how to express their ideas through art to create an artistic work presented to an audience.
“Through actual hands-on experience, the designers used what they are learning about the science and craft of lighting to help provide visual context to the dance,” said Evans.
