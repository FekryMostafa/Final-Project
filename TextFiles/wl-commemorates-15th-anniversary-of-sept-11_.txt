 Members of Washington and Lee’s Executive Committee, College Republicans and College Democrats placed American flags on the walkway between Lee Chapel and Washington Hall this weekend in remembrance of those who lost their lives in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001.
W&L alumni Rob Schlegel, of the Class of 1985, who died in the Pentagon, and James Gadiel, of the Class of 2000, who died in the World Trade Center, were among those lost.
Rob was on the staff of the chief of naval operations at the Pentagon and had been promoted to commander just weeks prior to the attack. James worked in the equities department of Cantor Fitzgerald, on the 103rd floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center.
The Lee Chapel bells will ring at 8:46 a.m. on Sunday to mark the 15th anniversary of first attack on the North Tower of World Trade Center. Flags on campus will be flown at half-staff, and the University’s women’s soccer and field hockey teams will have a moment of silence for the victims at their home contests, both of which will begin at 12:00 p.m.
You can watch Roanoke CBS affiliate WDBJ-7’s interview with W&L junior Caroline Bones about the commemoration.
