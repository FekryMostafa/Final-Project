The Office of Accreditation & Institutional Research administers the University's accreditation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) and leads all institutional research and reporting activities in support of Washington and Lee University's institutional effectiveness efforts. To fulfill its accreditation responsibilities, the office oversees and leads the decennial and fifth-year reaffirmations by SACSCOC, monitors the university's ongoing compliance with accreditation standards, coordinates and submits all substantive change, and documents student achievement in keeping with federal requirements. To ensure institutional effectiveness, the office provides comprehensive information to support institutional and departmental planning, policy formation, decision-making and evaluation of effectiveness. Additionally, we coordinate responses to external accountability mandates and a wide range of internal and external requests for information about the University.
