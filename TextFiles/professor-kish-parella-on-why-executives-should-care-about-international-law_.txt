Washington and Lee law professor Kish Parella has published a blog article on the Blue Sky blog, Columbia Law School’s blog on corporations and capital markets. In the article, “Why Should Corporate Executives Care about International Law?,” Parella explores the ways in which corporate stakeholders – including consumers, employees, suppliers, investors, financial institutions, benchmarking organizations, and NGOs – use various strategies to encourage corporate actors to integrate international law norms into their policies and practices. She identifies and examines four types of enforcement activities performed by stakeholders: direct, predicative, facilitative, and amplification.
“Collectively, these enforcement techniques offer important incentives for corporate actors to comply with international law.  These same strategies also influence other stakeholders’ commitment to enforcing it against corporate actors,” Parella writes.
Parella drew on two recent scholarly articles for the blog piece: “Enforcing International Law Against Corporations: A Stakeholder Management Approach,” forthcoming in the Harvard International Law Journal and “Corporate Governance & International Law,” forthcoming in the Alabama Law Review.
The full post is available on the CLS Blue Sky blog.
