From clocks that go into the floor to 11,000-year-old mastodon bones. Our tours and hands-on activities offer experiences  we’re certain our youngest guests will find to be a blast. And who knows, maybe their favorite grown-ups might have some fun too.
Offered seasonally, these special guided tours are uniquely designed for families with children ages 5 to 11.
