During this First Friday’s Gallery Walk in downtown Lexington on Aug. 5, be sure to stop by Sweet Treats Bakery to take a look at Mitch Keller’s solo photography exhibition.
An assistant math professor at Washington and Lee University, Mitch took up photography as a way to document his travels, and much of his work focuses on landscape work. “I love photographing natural beauty,” he said, “but the architectural beauty of our built environment fascinates me as well. I can’t imagine a day when I tire of photographing bridges or night cityscapes. I am working on developing an eye for more close-up sorts of photography, and perhaps the arrival of my nephew Jack and niece Emma will help me develop some skills at photographing people as well.”
For this show, Mitch said, “I think it’s fair to describe the exhibition as focused on landscape photographs incorporating a variety of scenes from Lexington and the surrounding area, as well as places I’ve visited around the world.”
Mitch is the treasurer of the Rockbridge Camera Club, as well as the faculty adviser for W&L’s baseball team.
You can see more of his work on his website.
