Gavron Campbell ’22 has won a Gilman Scholarship to complete an internship in Barcelona, Spain. At W&L, Campbell is majoring in business administration and minoring in digital culture and information.
The Gilman Scholarship is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and administered by the Institute of International Education.
On campus, Campbell has been involved with the Executive Committee since her first year, and she recently finished her term as the organization’s vice president. Currently, she is involved in Kathekon, InGeneral and the Outing Club.
“W&L continues to be so generous with their awards, scholarships and financial aid,” Campbell said. “I truly cannot thank the university enough for the endless opportunities they have made available to me. Interning abroad is a daunting experience, but because of this award, I feel like I have all the support I need to succeed.”
Campbell does not plan to complete the program until the summer after her senior year.
“My plan after the program is to either stay in Spain or move back to the United States and work in advertising,” she said.
The Gilman Scholarship Program, named for retired congressman Benjamin A. Gilman, seeks to diversify the kinds of students who study or intern abroad and the countries and regions where they go by offering awards to U.S. undergraduates.
If you know a W&L student who has done great, accolade-worthy things, tell us about them! Nominate them for an accolade.
