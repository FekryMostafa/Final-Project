While law schools have traditionally taught all students in the same way for all three years, at W&L Law, you will encounter a sequence of learning experiences rooted in the basic assumption that each year of law school should present new and different challenges while pushing you further along the continuum from beginning law student to lawyer-to-be. 
With a student body of around 370, a student-faculty ratio of 7 to 1, and a location among the most picturesque and as peaceful as exists, W&L Law offers a unique environment in which to immerse yourself in the study of law.
Founded in 1849, the School of Law has a rich history and counts among its alumni many distinguished practitioners, judges and entrepreneurs, including several U.S. Supreme Court Justices and the third most number of American Bar Associations presidents produced by any single law school.
