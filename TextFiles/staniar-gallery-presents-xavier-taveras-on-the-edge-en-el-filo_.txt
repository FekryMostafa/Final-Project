An exhibition of photographs by Minneapolis-based artist and photographer Xavier Tavera will open in Washington and Lee’s Staniar Gallery Sept. 2. The works will be on display through Sept. 27, with an artist’s talk and reception on Sept. 18. The event, which is free and open to the public, will begin at 5:30 p.m. in Wilson Hall’s Concert Hall.
After moving from Mexico City to the United States, Tavera said he experienced a sense of cultural alienation that compelled him to document the spaces, places, events, people and artifacts of those living in marginalized communities. His images offer insight into the diversity of numerous subcultures, giving a voice to those who are often invisible.
This exhibition focuses on the notion of borderlands as Tavera explores the echoes of cultural clashes at the United States/Mexican border that reverberate through other Latina/o/x geographies. Tavera has shown his work nationally and internationally, including Germany, Scotland, Mexico, Chile, Uruguay and China. He lives and works in Minneapolis and teaches at the University of Minnesota.
Staniar Gallery is located on the second floor of Wilson Hall, in Washington and Lee University’s Lenfest Center for the Arts. Gallery hours are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, please call 540-458-8861.
