An Open Access Discussion Panel will take place Oct. 24 in the Book Nook in Leyburn Llibrary at Washington and Lee University on Oct. 24 from 4:30â€“5:30 p.m.
Four W&L faculty will talk about their experiences with Open Access publishing, both from the editorial and authorial perspectives. It is free and open to the public. Refreshments will be provided.
The panel members include:
Open Access is the free, immediate, online availability of research articles coupled with the rights to use these articles fully in the digital environment. Open Access ensures that anyone can access and use these results to turn ideas into industries and breakthroughs into better lives.
