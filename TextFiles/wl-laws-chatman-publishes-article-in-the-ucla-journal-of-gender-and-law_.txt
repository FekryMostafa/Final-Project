Washington and Lee law professor Carliss Chatman has published an article in the UCLA Journal of Gender & Law. The article, “We Shouldn’t Need Roe,” argues for the need for federal action to protect reproductive rights.
“Decades of state law encroachments have caused Roe to fail to properly protect the right to choose. Building on prior works that challenge the premise of fetal personhood and highlighting the status of Roe-based rights after decades of challenges, this essay proposes an alternative solution to Roe. Federal legislative and executive efforts, including the Women’s Health Protection Act, are necessary to ensure the right to choose remains accessible to all pregnant persons,” writes Chatman.
The article is available online here.
