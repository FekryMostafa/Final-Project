Washington and Lee law professor Sarah Haan has published an article in the Stanford Law Review. The article, “Corporate Governance and the Feminization of Capital,” explores the largely forgotten history women played as corporate shareholders and details their early fights for inclusion on corporate boards.
“Corporate law scholarship has never before acknowledged that the early decades of the twentieth century, a transformational era in corporate law and theory, coincided with a change in the gender composition of the shareholder class. Scholars have not considered the possibility that shareholders’ gender—which was being tracked internally at companies, disclosed in annual reports, and publicly reported in the press—might have influenced business leaders’ views about corporate organization and governance,” writes Haan.
The article is available online at the Stanford Law Review website.
